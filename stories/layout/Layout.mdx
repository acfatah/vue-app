# Layout

Layout components handles a specific page structure like headers, toolbars, sidebars,
and main content areas.

We use vue-router to serve the main content, which corresponds to the HTML main
element. Toolbars are represented by the HTML nav elements, Sidebars are represented
by the HTML aside elements, while the footer is rendered using the HTML footer element.

<Source code={`
<template>
  <slot name="header" />
  <router-view />
  <slot name="footer" />
</template>
`} />
